		<h1 id="special"> It would be a living room </h1>
		<h1>about twenty-three feet long </h1>
		<h1>by ten feet wide. </h1>
		<h3> On the left, </h3>
		<h3> in a kind of recess,</h3>
		<h3> there would be a large sofa upholstered</h3>
		<h3> in worn black leather,</h3>
		<h3> with <a href=https://vermontwoodsstudios.com/products/cherry-moon-bookcase> pale cherrywood bookcases </a></h3>
		<h3> on either side,</h3>
		<h3> heaped with books</h3>

	<div class=medium>
		<p> Above the sofa, a <strong>mariner's chart </strong> would fill the whole length of that section of the wall. </p>
		<p> On the other side </p> 
		<p> of a small low table,</p>
		<p> and beneath a silk prayer-mat </p>
		<p> nailed to the wall </p>
		<p> with three large-headed brass studs, </p>
		<p> matching the leather curtain,</p>
		<p> there would be <em> another sofa,</em></p>
		<p> at right angles to the first,</p>
		<p> with a <a href=https://www.raymourflanigan.com/outlet/sofas-sectionals-clearance/telora-sofa-202210020?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=GSH_PMX_Outlet&utm_term=&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw0Oq2BhCCARIsAA5hubWXpF16V3mEHU6S1hHCwOzgWVA6VjONWyNuQat7d38uf-5uU-VC57oaApJ8EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds>light-brown velvet covering;  </a></p>

	<div class=small>
		<p> it would lead on to a small and spindly piece of furniture, lacquered in dark red and providing three display shelves for knick-knacks: 
			<ul>
				<li>agates and stone eggs,</li>
				<li>snuffboxes, </li>
				<li>candy-boxes,</li>

				<li>a mother-of-pearl oystershell,</li>
				<li>a silver fob watch,</li>

	<div class=large>
		<h1>Further on,</h1>
		<h1>beyond a padded door, </h1>
		<h1>there would be shelving </h1>
		<h1> on both sides of the corner,</h1>
		<h1> for caskets</h1>
		<h1> and for records, </h1>
		<h1> beside a <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2Kdu8jCX4o&ab_channel=BurmeseColourNeedles>closed gramophone </a></h1>

		<h3>Through the window,</h3>
		<h3> draped with white and brown curtains</h3>
		<h3> in cloth imitating Jouy wallpaper, </h3>
		<h3> <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/he1rdw/a_small_park_i_created_today/> you would glimpse a few trees,</h3>
		<h3> a tiny park,</h3>
		<h3> a bit of street. </a></h3>
		<h3>  A roll-top desk </h3>
		<h3> littered with papers and pen-holders</h3>
		<h3> would go with a small cane-seated chair.</h3>
	</div>
	<div class=small>
		<p>On a console table would be 
			<ol>
				<li>a telephone, </li>
				<li>a leather diary, </li> 
				<li>a writing pad.</li>
			</ol></p>
		<p>Then, </p>
		<p> on the other side of another door,</p>
		<p> beyond a low, square revolving bookcase</p>
		<p> supporting<a href=https://www.iamfy.co/product/yellow-flowers-in-a-blue-vase-art-print-2> <strong> a large, cylindrical vase decorated in blue and filled with yellow roses,</strong> </a></p>
		<p> set beneath an oblong mirror in a mahogany frame,</p>
		<p> there would be a narrow table</p>
		<p> with its two benches upholstered in tartan,</p>
		<p> which would bring your eye back to the leather curtain.</p>
	</div>
	<div class=blackandwhite>
		<p> Sometimes it would seem to them that a whole life could be led harmoniously between these book-lined walls, amongst these objects so perfectly domesticated that they would have ended up believing these bright, soft, simple and beautiful things had only ever been made for their sole use.</p>
		<p>But they wouldn't feel enslaved by them: on some days, they would go off on a chance adventure. </p>
		<p>No plan seemed impossible to them. </p>
		<p>They would not know rancour, or bitterness, or envy. </p>
		<p>For their means and their desires would always match in all ways. </p>
		<p>They would call this balance happiness and, with their freedom, with their wisdom and their culture, they would know how to retain and to reveal it in every moment of their living,together. </p>
	</div>
	<div class=blackandwhite>
		<p>They would have liked to be rich.</p>
		<p> They believed they would have been up to it.</p>
		<p> They would have known how to dress, how to look and how to smile like rich people.</p>
		<p> They would have had the requisite tact and discretion.</p>
		<p> They would have forgotten they were rich, would have grasped how not to flaunt their wealth.</p>
		<p> They wouldn't have taken pride in it.</p>
		<p> They would have drunk it into themselves.</p>
		<p> Their pleasures would have been intense.</p>
		<p> They would have liked to wander, to dawdle, to choose, to savour.</p>
		<p> They would have liked to live.</p>
		<p> Their lives would have been an art of living.</p>
	</div>
	<div class=blackandwhite>
		<p> But such things are far from easy.</p>
		<p> For this young couple, who were not rich but wanted to be, simply because they were not poor, there could be no situation more awkward.</p>
		<p> They had only what they deserved to have. They were thrown, when already they were dreaming of space, light, silence, back to the reality, which was not even miserable, but simply cramped (and that was perhaps even worse), of their tiny flat, of their everyday meals, of their puny holidays.</p>
		<p> That was what corresponded to their economic status, to their social situation.</p>
		<p> That was their reality and they had no other.</p>
		<p> But beside them, all around them, all along the streets where they could not but walk, existed the fallacious but nonetheless glowing offerings of antique-dealers, delicatessens and stationers.</p>
		<p> From Palais-Royal to Saint-Germain-des-Prés, from Champ-de-Mars to the Champs-Elysées, from the Luxembourg Gardens to Montparnasse, from Ile Saint-Louis to the Marais, from Place des Ternes to Place de l'Opéra, from Madeleine to the Monceau Gardens, the whole of Paris was a perpetual temptation.</p>
		<p> They burned with desire to give in to it, passionately, straight away and for ever.</p>
		<p> But the horizon of their desires was mercilessly blocked; their great impossible dreams belonged only to Utopia.</p>
	</div>
	<div class=blackandwhite>
		<p> They lived in a quaint, low-ceilinged and tiny flat overlooking a garden.</p>
		<p> And as they remembered their garret - a gloomy, narrow, overheated corridor with clinging smells - they lived in their flat, to begin with, in a kind of intoxication, refreshed each morning by the sound of chirping birds.</p>
		<p> They would open the windows and, for many minutes, they would gaze, in utter happiness, at their courtyard.</p>
		<p> The building was old, not yet at all at the point of collapse, but dowdy and cracked. The corridors and staircases were narrow and dirty, dripping with damp, impregnated with greasy fumes.</p>
		<p> But in between two large trees and five tiny garden plots of irregular shapes, most of them overgrown but endowed with precious lawn, flowers in pots, bushes, even primitive statues, there wound a path made of rough, large paving stones which gave the whole thing a countryside air.</p>
		<p> It was one of those rare spots in Paris where it could happen, on some autumn days, after rain, that a smell would rise from the ground, an almost powerful smell of the forest, of earth, of rotting leaves.</p>
	</div>
	<div class=blackandwhite>
		<p> They never tired of these charms and they always remained just as naturally responsive to them as they had been on the first day, but it became obvious, after a few care-free, jaunty months, that these attractions could in no way suffice to make them oblivious of the inadequacies of their dwelling.</p>
		<p> Accustomed to living in squalid rooms where all they did was to sleep, and to spending their days in cafés, they took a long time to notice that the most banal functions of everyday life - sleeping, eating, reading, chatting, washing — each required a specific space, the manifest absence of which then began to make itself felt.</p>
		<p> They found consolation where they could, congratulated themselves on the excellent neighbourhood they were in, on the proximity of Rue Mouffetard and the Jardin des Plantes, on the quietness of the street, on the stylishness of their low ceilings, and on the magnificence of the trees and the courtyard through all the seasons; but indoors it all began to collapse under the heaps of objects, of furniture, books, plates, papers, empty bottles.</p>
		<p> A war of attrition began from which they would never emerge victorious.</p>
	</div>
	<div class=blackandwhite>
		<p> With a total floor area of <strong>thirty-five square metres,</strong> which they never dared check, their flat consisted of a minute entrance hall, a cramped kitchen, half of which had been converted into a washroom, a modest-sized bedroom, an all-purpose room - library, living-room or study, spare bedroom - and an ill-defined nook, halfway between a broom-cupboard and a corridor, in which space had somehow been found for a matchbox fridge, an electric water-heater, an improvised wardrobe, a table, at which they ate, and a laundry-box which doubled up as a bench-seat.</p>
	</div>
		<div class=blackandwhite>
		<p> On some days the lack of space became overwhelming.  </p>
		<p> They would suffocate.</p>
		<p> But it was no use pushing back the boundaries of their two-roomed flatlet, no use knocking down walls, calling up corridors, cupboards, openings, no use imagining ideal wardrobes or taking over adjacent flats in their dreams, they would always end up back in what was their lot, their only lot: </p>
		<p> thirty-five square metres.</p>
